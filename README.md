# Cafe Eunoia Menu
Made a cafe menu making use of basic HTML and CSS

# HTML Learnt

Used the HTML Layout that exists in the VSCode through the shortcut : Shift + 1
Then I learnt about the usage of section, body, main, article, header, and footer tags.
Also used the div and hr tags to help in styling.

# CSS Learnt

Learnt about styling the tags by directly coding like:
body{
}

Styling through class name:
.class-name{
}

Used a lot of properties like background-image, font-size, font-family, padding, background-color, border-color, and more for basic formatiing.
More properties that had major effect in placing the HTML components on page were: margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, margin-bottom, display, text-align.
